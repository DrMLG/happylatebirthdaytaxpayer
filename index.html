Section, Price, take &lsquo;em out&rdquo;. Price and Section take out the guards by knocking them unconscious and hiding them in the janitors closet. &ldquo;Cut their radio wires and hook them up to this, it recognises what they say and respond, it&rsquo;ll buy us some time. Lets go&rdquo; Section and Price do </span><span>what Taxpayer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;told them and they move. Taxpayer puts up his headphones and goes on the radio &ldquo;Karasu, Axel, where are you?&rdquo; Taxpayer says then his radio makes a static noise and she gets a response. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the far end of the building. I&rsquo;m picking you three up on my radar, hang tight and stay where you are&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About five minutes later they arrive and everyone regroups. &ldquo;If my radar is correct&rdquo; Taxpayer says &ldquo;We got a MERC UAV entering our airspace and a payload with multiple hostiles on it&rdquo; he says. Axel looks at Karasu &ldquo;You have a predator missile. Once those things get close we can knock them out of the sky, hooah?&rdquo; Karasu looks over at Axel &ldquo;Wait, Let&#39;s do it if worst comes to worst, Hooah?&rdquo; Taxpayer looks at both of them &ldquo;Hooah&rdquo;. They move down the dome to a locked door. &ldquo;This has an electronic lock, a keycard is needed&rdquo; He points at the lock &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna hotwire it, you four cover me&rdquo; and he gets to work. He rewires it and &hellip; nothing, &ldquo;Dear lord! Why wont it work!&rdquo; He hits it and &hellip; click!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Price and Section, stack up on me&rdquo; Taxpayer says and points at Axel and Karasu &ldquo;You two on that side, we don&rsquo;t know how many MERC are going to start shooting.&rdquo;Axel and Karasu stack up on the opposite side of Taxpayer, Section, and Price. Taxpayer opens the door and moves into the hallway, he can see about 9 to 15 MERCs but it is too hard to see them because of how far they are away. &ldquo;Move into the room on the far right&rdquo; Taxpayer says and they move into it. &ldquo;Give me that water bottle so I can attract their attention&rdquo; Taxpayer says, nods his head towards Axel, and points at a water bottle. Axel throws it to him and he catches it. Taxpayer walks over to the door and whips it into the hallway. One MERC soldier sees it and alerts the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MERCs start walking down the hall, once they&rsquo;re close enough Taxpayer throws a 9-Bang, a type of flashbang that goes off 9 times, and the MERCs don&rsquo;t notice and get blinded. &ldquo;Take them out!&rdquo; Taxpayer yells, then the MERCs run and alert the person controlling the UAV. The UAV swoops by and starts shooting in whilst the MERCs start running towards Taxpayer and his crew. &ldquo;Use the Predator Karasu, come-&rsquo; Taxpayer starts saying but then is cut off by multiple gunshots. Karasu starts firing back and is too busy to pull out the Predator control. Taxpayer gets annoyed and runs to Karasu, punches him, grabs the control and shoots the Predator Missile at the MERC UAV. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Taxpayer yells, smashing the window and vaults through. His crew follows him and they get to cover. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to move to the back of the building and move in through the back door, hooah?&rdquo; Taxpayer looks at his crew. &ldquo;Hooah&rdquo; His crew responds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they do, Taxpayer&rsquo;s crew moves to the back. &ldquo;Breaching!&rdquo; He yells after hot wiring the door. He opens the door and runs through, running towards the MERCs and hides behind a desk. &ldquo;Take cover!&rdquo; He yells and starts shooting at the MERCs. The MERCs retreat back down the hallway and into a car. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; Taxpayer yells &ldquo;Oorah!&rdquo; His crew yells. Taxpayer goes over his radio &ldquo;Nikolai, get us out of here.&rdquo; and they got out of there. Mostly cars drove them out, but they still got out.</span></p></body></html>
<!--so in early 2020 i started writing frequently. i wrote about us marines, it was corny and ameture sure but i had a good time. a lot of it was written in class. it was inspired by call of duty mainly, the names based off of captain macmillans line "50,000 people used to live here, now its a ghost town" and theres 1. a CoD character in it 2. tons of elements inspired by black ops 2. anyways, i was looking today and found an old thing i wrote and remembered "hey i forgot to do something for the year anniversary of taxpayer, so im gonna release the first thing i wrote. titled "100,000 American Patriots" i wrote it on january 30th, 2020. in class.-->
