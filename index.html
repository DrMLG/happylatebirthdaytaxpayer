<p>so in early 2020 i started writing frequently. i wrote about us marines, it was corny and ameture sure but i had a good time. a lot of it was written in class. it was inspired by call of duty mainly, the names based off of captain macmillans line "50,000 people used to live here, now its a ghost town" and theres 1. a CoD character in it 2. tons of elements inspired by black ops 2</p>
<p>anyways, i was looking today and found an old thing i wrote and remembered "hey i forgot to do something for the year anniversary of taxpayer, so im gonna release the first thing i wrote. titled "100,000 American Patriots" i wrote it on january 30th, 2020. in class.</p>

<p>“100,000 people used to live here” Taxpayer says. “100,000 American patriots, but now-” Taxpayer points at two MERC patrols “These guys took it. Section, Price, take ‘em out”. Price and Section take out the guards by knocking them unconscious and hiding them in the janitors closet. “Cut their radio wires and hook them up to this, it recognises what they say and respond, it’ll buy us some time. Lets go” Section and Price do what Taxpayer told them and they move. Taxpayer puts up his headphones and goes on the radio “Karasu, Axel, where are you?” Taxpayer says then his radio makes a static noise and she gets a response. “We’re at the far end of the building. I’m picking you three up on my radar, hang tight and stay where you are”</p>
